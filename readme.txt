The purpose of this project is to create a basic rougelike game, set on a derelict spaceship,
which has enemies, loot, etc. etc. As the project goes on, perhaps it will become more defined, but
for now this is really just an exercise to test some Python coding skills.

To run the game, you need something that can run Python scripts, such as the Anaconda distribution of Python.
